# How to Run?
## Software Environment
1. Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. Version 2017
2. Visual Studio 2015.
PS: The version here is the one I use. Any version that can run the codes is okay.

## Step
1. Git clone my repo.
2. First of all, you should use Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to open the `MasterPro.ssmssln` under folder `MasterSQLPro`.
3. Second, you should connect the local server, and run my code in file `SQLQuery1.sql`, `SQLQuery2.sql` and `SQLQuery3.sql`. The file `SQLQuery4.sql` should be ignored its using for test.
4. After establishing the database, you can use Visual Studio with any version to open `MasterPro.sln` under folder `MasterPro`.
5. Finally, compile and run.
